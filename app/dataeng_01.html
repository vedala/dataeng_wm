                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    To find datasets that I could use for my demo data engineering project,
                    I started with a simple Google search and found <a href="https://www.springboard.com/blog/free-public-data-sets-data-science-project/">this</a> blog post among several useful hits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of the datasets described in the above blog post, I picked Walmart Recruiting Store Sales data.
                    Some of the reasons for picking this dataset inclulde:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Retail data, easy to understand domain</li>
                    <li>This data is hosted on Kaggle, very good description of data is provided by Kaggle</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Source data located <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting">here</a>.

                <h2>Schema Design</h2>
                <h3>Data Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    The data provided is historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores for years
                    2010 thru 2012.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The primary data is weekly department-wise sales amount for each store.
                    Another piece of information included is whether a given week is a holiday
                    week or a reguler week. For the purpose of this data, only the following four
                    are considered holidays: Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving and
                    Christmas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, data is available that provides information such temperature
                    in the region, fuel price and markdowns etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of the files available from the data source, I used the following files for this
                    data engineering project:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>train.csv</li>
                    <li>features.csv</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Schema Design</h3>
                <p>
                    Applying dimensional design process on the data yields one dimension
                    and two fact tables. The tables and their fields are listed below:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>date dimension
                        <ul>
                            <li>Id (PK)</li>
                            <li>Date</li>
                            <li>Is Holiday?</li>
                            <li>Holiday Name</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    </li>
                    <li>features fact

                <h2>Data Cleaning and Preparation</h2>
                <p>
                    Data cleaning requirements are based on the ETL tool used. I picked
                    <a href="https://www.stitchdata.com/">Stitch</a> as the ETL tool for
                    this project. I have described the process of selecting the ETL tool
                    in the next section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, I will describe cleaning and prepration I performed while creating
                    each of the dimension and fact CSV files. Because the ETL tool that I picked
                    is a sync-only tool, I had to perform cleaning of certain data items that
                    would otherwise be performed by the ETL tool (I found Stitch to be great
                    even with this limitation).
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data dimension CSV file generation
                        <ul>
                            <li>extract only Date and isHoliday columns from source sales data</li>
                            <li>sort on Date field and output only unique rows</li>
                            <li>data for a few weeks in not available for the years 2010 and 2012.
                                Add rows for 2010 and 2012 dates that are missing from data</li>
                            <li>insert holiday_name field into data for appropriate rows</li>
                            <li>add sequence data as first column, this will serve as primary key of dimension table created from the CSV file</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Sales fact CSV file generation
                        <ul>
                            <li>delete IsHoliday field</li>
                            <li>replace "Date" field with "Date Key" foreign key, lookup date
                                key from date dimension created above</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Features fact CSV file generation
                        <ul>
                            <li>features data contains "NA" for missing data values, since these
                                items are numeric, convert them to 0.0</li>
                            <li>delete IsHoliday field</li>
                            <li>similar to what was done for sales fact generation, replace
                                "Date" field with "Date Key" foreign key</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Data Load</h2>
                <p>
                    Stitch is used as ETL tool (<a href="https://www.stitchdata.com/">link</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stitch is a sync-only provider. Stitch tool does not provide any
                    transform ability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why Stitch
                    i) offers free account. The only cloud-based ETL tool I found that offers
                       a free account.
                    ii) Once I started using Stitch, I found the service to be execellent.
                        The free account allows only one destination to be added. This was
                        adequate for my needs.

                <h2>Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                    The following analyses are sample of possible analyses that can be
                    performed on the data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Analysis buttons kick off ajax calls to AWS Lambda functions.

                    The lambda functions run analysis SQL queries on the postgres
                    database and return the result to the web application.
